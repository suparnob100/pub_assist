### **Using the `endfloat` Package in LaTeX**

The **`endfloat`** package moves all figures and tables to the end of the document, which is often required for journal submissions. By default, LaTeX places floats near their first reference in the text. This package overrides that behavior, ensuring that all floats appear at the end in a dedicated section.

#### **Basic Usage**
To use `endfloat`, add the following to your LaTeX preamble:

```latex
\usepackage{endfloat}
```
This will automatically move all figures and tables to the end of the manuscript.

#### **Options for Customization**
1. **Suppressing In-Text Markers**  
   By default, `endfloat` replaces figures and tables with placeholders like:
   ```
   [Figure about here.]
   [Table about here.]
   ```
   To remove these markers, use the `nomarkers` option:
   ```latex
   \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
   ```

2. **Separating Figures and Tables**
   By default, `endfloat` places figures and tables together. To ensure tables appear before figures, use:
   ```latex
   \usepackage[tablesfirst]{endfloat}
   ```

3. **Removing Float List Entries**
   If you do not want figures and tables to be listed separately in the `\listoffigures` or `\listoftables`, use:
   ```latex
   \usepackage[nofiglist, notablist]{endfloat}
   ```

4. **Customizing Float Placement**
   The default separator between figures and tables can be adjusted using:
   ```latex
   \renewcommand{\efloatseparator}{\mbox{}}
   ```
   This ensures there is no unwanted space or text between them.

5. **Handling Long Floats in Separate Files**
   Some journals require figures and tables to be submitted separately. The `endfloat` package supports this with the `floatsonly` option:
   ```latex
   \usepackage[floatsonly]{endfloat}
   ```
   This ensures that only floats are processed, excluding the main body of the document.

6. **Allowing Some Floats to Stay in the Main Text**
   If you need specific figures or tables to remain in the main text, wrap them in:
   ```latex
   \begin{figure}[H]
   \centering
   \includegraphics{example.pdf}
   \caption{Example figure that remains in the text.}
   \end{figure}
   ```
   The `[H]` option (from the `float` package) forces the float to remain in place.
